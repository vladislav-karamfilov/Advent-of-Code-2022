# Advent of Code 2022

This repo holds my solutions of the puzzles from the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) event.

---

All puzzle solutions are Rust console apps that you can run in [Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup) or in your favorite terminal (using [`cargo run`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html)).

Puzzle texts and inputs are in a git submodule and are not public because of the [copyright rules of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about#faq_copying). You can find all puzzle texts in the [Advent of Code 2022 calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Puzzle inputs specific to you will be available when you log in.

While solving the puzzles from the event I strived to:
- learn Rust and explore its powerful features (ownership model, error handling, functional programming paradigms, etc.) and standard library while solving engaging coding puzzles.
- practice solving problems with more algorithmic aspect than my everyday job (learnt some cool new algorithms)
- have fun coding!
